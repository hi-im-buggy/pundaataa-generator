# Pundaata Generator

Insert your own message into the Pundaata meme template, inspired by
[@pundaata](https://www.instagram.com/pundaata/).

## How to use

Just run the `rewrite.py` script, and input your meme text. For Linux/MacOS,

```sh
python3 rewrite.py
```

Or on Windows,

```batch
py rewrite.py
```

When prompted, enter the text you want to input, and done. You should get a jpg file `output.jpg`,
which has the text in the "pundaata" format.
